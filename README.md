# Machine Learning

The field of Machine Learning has become more prevalent throughout the last decade. 
This repository is for me to keep track of all the papers I read as well as my notes about
them. I occasionally implement some of the models and push them up as well. 

## Contributions 
I appreciate all model implementation contributions as well as bug fixes on the
currently existing ones. Feel free to open up issues if there is anything wrong 
with the current implementations as well.
